<p>
  Pixelorama is a free & open source pixel art sprite editor, with animation
  support. It is made entirely with the Godot&nbsp;Engine. Current features as of
  version v0.9:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>16 different tools to help you draw, which you can map to both of your left and right mouse buttons.</li>
  <li>Are you an animator? Pixelorama has its own animation timeline just for you! You can work at an individual cel level, where each cel refers to a unique layer and frame. Supports onion skinning, cel linking, motion drawing and frame grouping with tags.</li>
  <li>Different tool options for each of the mouse buttons.</li>
  <li>Custom brushes, including random brushes.</li>
  <li>Create or import custom palettes.</li>
  <li>Pattern filling! Use the bucket tool to fill out an area with a pattern of your choosing.</li>
  <li>Import images and edit them inside Pixelorama. If you import multiple files, they will be added as individual animation frames. Importing spritesheets is also supported.</li>
  <li>Export your gorgeous art as PNG or GIF files. Exporting your projects as spritesheets is also possible.</li>
  <li>Pixel perfect mode for perfect lines, for the pencil, eraser & lighten/darken tools.</li>
